# task-manager

## Overview

This is a project that I am working on from scratch to learn about how to create a functional python project.

## File Structure

```graphsql
task_manager/
├── main.py          # Application entry point
├── database.py      # Database connection and operations
├── task.py          # Task operations and business logic
├── ui.py            # User interface
└── timer.py         # Timer functionality
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Test the connection

#### Create basic CRUD operations

- [ ] Implement functions to add new tasks to the database
- [ ] Create functionality to retrieve tasks
- [ ] Develop update capabilities for existing tasks
- [ ] Add delete functionality for removing tasks
- [ ] Test each operation

### Phase 3: Core Task Management Features

- [ ] Implement sorting options (by priority, deadline, etc.)

#### Implement task modification

- [ ] Create functionality to edit task properties
- [ ] Implement status change operations
- [ ] Add automatic updating of last_updated field
- [ ] Test modification operations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

#### Build the timer functionality

- [ ] Create informative error messages
- [ ] Develop confirmation dialogues for important actions

#### Create dashboard views

- [ ] Design summary view of task status
- [ ] Implement priority-based task display
- [ ] Add deadline alerts for upcoming tasks
- [ ] Create productivity metrics display

### Phase 6: Refinement and Extension

#### Add data validation and error handling

- [ ] Implement comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Create robust error handling
- [ ] Add database transaction management
- [ ] Develop recovery mechanisms for unexpected errors

#### Optimize performance

- [ ] Review database queries for efficiency

- [ ] Test with larger datasets to ensure scalability

#### Add data export/import capabilities

- [ ] Create CSV/JSON export functionality
- [ ] Implement backup features
- [ ] Add import capabilities for migrating data
- [ ] Test data integrity during import/export

### Phase 7: Project Completion

#### Perform comprehensive testing

- [ ] Test all features systematically
- [ ] Identify and fix any bugs
